## Supported plugins

Pelican blogging system comes with additional plugins that you can install and activate for your website. For more information see the [pelican-plugins](https://github.com/getpelican/pelican-plugins) repository.

Here are the plugins that should work out of the box with that theme if enabled:

* [related posts](https://github.com/getpelican/pelican-plugins/tree/master/related_posts)

    Displays related articles at the bottom of a blog post being read.

* [i18n subsites](https://github.com/getpelican/pelican-plugins/tree/master/i18n_subsites)

    Extends the translations functionality by creating internationalized sub-sites for the default site. Also takes care of translating theme items.


## Localization | Translation

This theme has some items / texts marked as localized in templates files. It relies on the [Jinja2 i18n extension] (http://jinja.pocoo.org/docs/templates/#i18n) to do the job and replace these texts with their translated couterparts in the appropriate language.

It means that you need to enable the jinja2.ext.i18n extension by adding the following line to your pelican configuration :
```python
JINJA_EXTENSIONS = ['jinja2.ext.i18n']
```

*THIS IS MANDATORY*, please don't skip this step otherwise you won't be able to generate the website.
